\title{\textbf{TradeSymphony} \\ 
       \large Multi-Agent Investment Analysis System}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
TradeSymphony is a multi-agent AI system built on CrewAI that replicates the collaborative decision-making structure of institutional investment firms. The system employs specialized AI agents working in a hierarchical organization to perform comprehensive investment analysis and generate portfolio recommendations. This document provides a concise overview of the system architecture, agent design, and multi-agent coordination mechanisms.
\end{abstract}

\section{System Overview}

\subsection{Problem Domain}
Investment analysis requires diverse expertise spanning fundamental analysis, risk assessment, compliance monitoring, and strategic decision-making. Traditional approaches suffer from human biases and scalability limitations.

\subsection{Solution Approach}
TradeSymphony addresses these challenges through a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate within a structured organizational framework, mimicking institutional investment firms while leveraging AI consistency and computational power.

\section{Multi-Agent Architecture}

\subsection{Agent Hierarchy}

The system implements a professional investment firm structure with 10 specialized agents:
